    <text>I went into my bedroom and flipped the light switch. Oh, I see that the ceiling lamp is not turning on. It must be that the light bulb needs replacement. I go through my closet and find a new light bulb that will fit this lamp and place it in my pocket. I also get my stepladder and place it under the lamp. I make sure the light switch is in the off position. I climb up the ladder and unscrew the old light bulb. I place the old bulb in my pocket and take out the new one. I then screw in the new bulb. I climb down the stepladder and place it back into the closet. I then throw out the old bulb into the recycling bin. I go back to my bedroom and turn on the light switch. I am happy to see that there is again light in my room.</text>

    <text>The weather was so nice today that I decided to have a barbecue. I called up some of my friends to invite them over. I set up some chairs and tables outside for my friends to sit around. I then took out some hot dogs from my fridge and brought them over to my barbecue. My barbecue is a gas barbecue, so all I had to do was press the knob and turn it to ignite it. Once I got a little fire going I put my hot dogs on the grill over it to cook. I closed the lid and left my hot dogs to cook for about ten minutes. After ten minutes I decided to check on them to see if they were done. They looked like they were cooked, so I put them all on a plate to serve to my friends. I went to my kitchen and got hot dog buns, ketchup, mustard, and relish to serve on top of the hot dogs. I laid out all of the food and condiments on the table so my friends could help themselves. We ate the hot dogs and relaxed around the table.</text>

    <text>On Sunday mornings, our paper boy usually has the paper delivered by 7 AM.  He rides his bike through the neighborhood and tosses the papers on everyone's yards before most anyone gets up.  When I wake up on Sunday mornings, I put on my robe and put on my slippers.  I walk down the stairs and go to the door.  I unlock it and go outside to look for my paper.  I walk down the steps and I see it on the lawn, carefully wrapped in plastic, protecting it from the weather.  I grab the paper and pull it out of the plastic as I walk back up the steps and go back into my house.  I throw away the plastic and sit at the table while my coffee brews.  I scan over the paper looking at the different articles, focusing on one in particular about a local political debate.</text>

    <text>Last time I had to paint a wall was when I bought a new house. Although the house was new to me, it was a fixer upper house. As a result, the house had a lot of quirks and one of which was the painting on the wall. It was not updated and did not look great. As a result, I felt that I needed to redo the paint. in doing so, I decided to get paint that was interesting to me and after purchasing the paint, I completed the paint job by myself. This was a great experience and I enjoyed painting and using primer and such and I felt that I did a great job at completing this task by myself. It was rewarding to be able to do it by myself. Afterward, my room looked great and I enjoyed seeing it look different than before. It was wonderful.</text>
