    <text>I went into my bedroom and flipped the light switch. Oh, I see that the ceiling lamp is not turning on. It must be that the light bulb needs replacement. I go through my closet and find a new light bulb that will fit this lamp and I place it in my pocket. I also get my stepladder and I place it under the lamp. I make sure the light switch is in the off position. I climb up the ladder and unscrew the old light bulb. I place the old bulb in my pocket and take out the new one. I then screw in the new bulb. I climb down the stepladder and I place it back into the closet. I then throw out the old bulb into the recycling bin. I go back to my bedroom and turn on the light switch. I am happy to see that there is again light in my room.</text>

    <text>Last time I had to paint a wall was when I bought a new house. Although the house was new to me, it was a fixer upper house. As a result, the house had a lot of quirks and one of which was the painting on the wall. It was not updated and did not look great. As a result, I felt that I needed to redo the paint. In doing so, I decided to get paint that was interesting to me and after purchasing the paint, I completed the paint job by myself. This was a great experience and I enjoyed painting and using primer and such and I felt that I did a great job at completing this task by myself. It was rewarding to be able to do it by myself. Afterward, my room looked great and I enjoyed seeing it look different than before. It was wonderful.</text>
