	* partial alignments of event descriptions that are semantically similar with respect to the given scenario

* Directory structure:
	/esds - contains the crowdsourced Event Sequence Descriptions (ESDs) that were collected
	/alignments - contains the crowdsourced partial alignments of event descriptions that are semantically similar with respect to the given scenario
	/gold_paraphrase_sets - contains a gold standard corpus of aligned event descriptions annotated by experts. The gold standard covers 10 scenarios, with 50 ESDs each
