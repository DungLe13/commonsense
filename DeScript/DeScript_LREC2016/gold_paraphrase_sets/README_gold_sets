The DeScript corpus also includes a gold standard corpus of aligned event descriptions annotated by experts. The gold standard covers 10 scenarios, with 50 ESDs each, separated into two files of 25 ESDs each. 

Each scenario file contains several paraphrase sets identified by "event" attribute that depicts the script event being expressed in the paraphrase set.

Explanation of particular "event" labels:
UnrelEv - depicts an event that is not part of the script
RelNScrEv - depicts an event that is related to the script but not necessarily part of the script
other_* - depicts an event that could be part of the script but is considered to be too fine-rained or is not mentioned often enough. 

Each item in a paraphrase set is identified by the "source", "script"(script_ID of the ESD where the event description comes from) and "slot" attributes. "total_slots" attribute gives the total number of slots in the ESD where the event description comes from.

Example paraphrase set:

<label type="PARAPHRASE" event="measure_ingredients">
<item source="2" script="3" slot="3" total_slots="13" original="Measure each ingredient according to the recipe"></item>
<item source="1" script="11" slot="5" total_slots="16" original="Measure wet ingredients."></item>
<item source="1" script="11" slot="6" total_slots="16" original="Measure dry ingredients."></item>
</label>
