We collected the ESDs in two phases:
* a pilot phase with 10 scenarios and 10 ESDs each 
and 
* a second phase with 40 scenarios 100 ESDs each. 

The ESDs were manually checked and erroneous ESDs removed.

Each file contains several ESDs identified with "id" and "source" attributes. The "source" attribute can either be "1" (collected during the pilot phase) or "2" (collected in the second phase).

Each event description has a "slot" attribute which is its position within the script sequence.
